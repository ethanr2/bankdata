However, like a separate account life insurance policy, a hybrid policy’s cash surrender value is supported by assets segregated from the general assets of the insurance carrier. Because they are legally segregated, the assets of each separate account are not subject to claims on the insurer that arise out of any other business of the insurance company. Additionally, the bank holding the hybrid account life insurance policy is able to select the investment strategy in which the insurance premiums are invested. Under such an arrangement, the policyholder neither owns the underlying separate account created by the insurance carrier on its behalf nor controls investment. data available as of march 2011 for call reports only, not available for tfr filers.
